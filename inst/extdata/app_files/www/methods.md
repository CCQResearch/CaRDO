# Methods

## Age Standarised Rates {#asr}

Age-standarised rates (ASR) are statistical measures used to compare the occurrence of a particular event (such as disease incidence or mortality) across different populations with varying age distributions. This measure is essential because populations with different age structures may have varying rates of events due to the fact that certain age groups are more (or less) vulnerable to the event in question. By standarising the rates to a common age distribution, you can make fairer comparisons between populations, eliminating the influence of age differences.

$$\sum_{i = 1}^{18} \frac{events_{i}}{population_{i}} \times weights_{i} \times 100,000$$

## Life Time Risk {#ltr}

Lifetime risk refers to the probability that an individual will develop a specific disease or condition during their lifetime, often expressed as a percentage or a fraction. It provides a summary measure of the risk of developing a particular disease or condition over the course of a lifetime, taking into account factors like age, gender, and population-specific characteristics. Lifetime risk is commonly used in public health and epidemiology to convey the likelihood of disease development within a population over time.

$$1 - \prod_{i=1}^{n}(1 - Age - Specific\ Risk_{i})$$

## Data Sources {#data-sources}

*This is where a description of the data sources (user supplied) will be written. I believe data sources could be entered in as a list and displayed as a list here as well.*

- *Source 2*
- *Source 3*

*A generic 'The data sources that were used to construct this dashboard are below...' could be used.*
